When the facility's backers send an executive (Samuel L. Jackson) … Continued. Sorry I’ve not been in touch guys. It’s been a busy month. However, I’m pleased to announce that, as of yesterday night, I’ve finally touched down in Phoenix, Arizona. I’m posting this log from my first American hotel room, which offers a gorgeous view of both the state hospital and a local prison. Auspicious times. Drop me a line if you’re in the city or if you have any information at all. Part 1 (https://redd.it/7asz8x) Part 2 (https://redd.it/7bkk41) Part 3 (https://redd.it/7cf4h8). 
My hat is like a shark's fin Wow does this movie ever need a proper blu ray release, and not one coupled with that abortion of a "sequel". Saw this in the theatre with my dad, and still to this day whenever he sees Sam Jackson in anything he'll laugh about how quickly he was eaten "in that shark movie". Let's be straight though, 'Deep Blue Sea' is not a great film but it sure as hell is one of the most ridiculous and entertaining shark/action movies out there. I loved Imagine if Renny Harlin’s Deep Blue Sea was filled with awful dialogue, horrific acting and unlikable/unmemorable characters and you’d have Deep Blue Sea 2 , one of the worst movies I’ve seen this year. The original Deep Blue Sea is one of those films that I know is implausible, but it’s one of my guilty pleasures. That film had a terrific ensemble of actors (Samuel L. Jackson, Thomas Jane, Saffron Burrows, Stellan Skarsgard, Michael Rappaport, LL Cool J, etc.) and some wonderfully.

Jaws and it’s sequel are both fantastic examples of a criminally ill done by genre and Deep Blue Sea did over the top action sharks that have brains flawlessly. Within the same sort of genre we also have the ‘eh’ Opem Water, Piranha 3D (because they basically acted like mini sharks) and Shark Night (let’s just not). Now nearly twenty years after the original Hello, FG Reddit. I am back to resume my task as host of the weekly post - first time on Reddit! Hoping it goes down well. Last fortnight I went through the Jaws quadrilogy as well as couple other shark features.

Saturday night, after my friends and I got back from a horror convention, we were decidedly in the mood for something scary to end the night. We found out the DVD player was out of commission so we weren't able to watch one of the many movies we bought at the con. Instead, we were relegated to choosing a movie that was OnDemand. "The Shallows" was one of the first movies we saw that had a decent Rotten Tomatoes rating (currently certified fresh at 78%). I have issues with Rotten Tomatoes Deep Blue Sea. Background: British actress Saffron Burrows first came to prominent as a fashion model for major designers like Yves Saint Laurent, before launching a prolific acting career. There are a LOT of bad shark movies, even or especially from the Jaws franchise. But Deep Blue Sea somehow manages to swim above the rest. It's a good addition to a BD collection if you want to watch monster sharks outsmart the human. ##### Deep Blue Sea ####Director(s): Renny Harlin Deep Blue Sea is a 1999 science fiction horror film that stars Saffron Burrows, Thomas Jane, LL Cool J, Michael Rapaport, Stellan Skarsgård and Samuel L.
